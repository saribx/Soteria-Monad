"""The assessor's reasoning step, running as an AgentApp on the hosted model runtime.

Input is only what the assessor may see: traffic lights, thresholds, flags,
coarse classes and the driver's report. No raw party data ever reaches this app.

The model access comes from the runtime (FLWR_RUNTIME_BASE_URL /
FLWR_RUNTIME_API_KEY, set for every AgentApp) -- no own API key.

Output: every model stream event goes to `agent.events`, and one final stdout
line `SOTERIA_LLM {json}` carries the model name and the answer text. The local
assessor parses that line strictly and applies its guardrails.

You never see raw data from other companies. You receive only traffic lights

and coarse cargo classes, plus the driver's report.

Choose the measures to take now. Prefer the most reversible measures that make
the situation safe. Safety comes before feasibility, feasibility before liability,
liability before cost. A damaged hazmat wagon on an immobilized train, or near
inhabited areas, requires stopping the train and notifying the authority. A
blocked track with an available diversion calls for alternative transport. A
yellow temperature with cooling required and a green customer stock calls only
for cooling.

Available measures and their reversibility tier:
