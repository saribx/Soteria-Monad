"""The collaboration charter: who may talk to whom, with which tools, on what budget.

The framework gives an AgentApp a model, connectors, events and run state. It does
not give it a way to call another agent. This module is the missing piece: a
declarative description of an agent team that can be checked *before* any model
runs, so the delegation graph is data rather than prompt text.

## What this layer does and does not guarantee

It **does** guarantee, in Python rather than in a prompt:

- a role can only delegate to the targets it declares;
- a role is only ever offered the connectors it declares;
- the delegation graph is acyclic, so the bill is bounded;
- no single role both reads private data and holds an outbound tool.

It **does not** claim to track secrets through free text. A supervisor is a
model, and "pass only what is required" is a request, not a control. The
run-level taint rule in `ledger.py` is the enforceable part: once a private
report enters a run, delegation to any role holding an outbound tool is refused.
That is deliberately coarse. It is sound precisely because it never inspects
strings.
