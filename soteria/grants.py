"""Approval tiers by reversibility, and who granted them.

This module guarantees two properties:

- **An agent never grants itself approval.** `give()` rejects every `human_id`
  that is a role name. There is no path by which a model signs itself in:
  `give()` is only called from the case file and by the operator, never from
  `team.py` or `assessor_app.py`.
- **A grant is valid for exactly these parameters.** The comparison runs over
  `digest(params)`, so it is independent of key order and sensitive to any
  change. A changed field yields `grant_mismatch`, not `no_grant` -- that
  difference is half the demo: "there was a grant, but not for this".
