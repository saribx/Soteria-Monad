"""The assessor as a rule engine. Sees only projections.

This file knows no case ID and no stored ground truth -- it receives traffic
lights (ampel), thresholds (schwelle) and flags and decides from them.
`tests/test_policy.py` checks this by searching the source for case names. If
there were an `if case_id == "s3"` anywhere here, the hit rate would be a number
about itself.

**Honesty:** the order of the rules was written against the known cases. Their
hit rate is therefore a consistency check, not a claim. The rate over the
holdout cases, which the data track does not reveal, is the only number that
claims anything.

The order of the rules is the order of irreversibility:
safety before feasibility before liability before cost.
