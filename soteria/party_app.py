"""The ClientApp that runs on a party's machine.

Start on the party's computer:

    flower-supernode --insecure --superlink 127.0.0.1:9092 \
        --node-config 'party="customer_c1_frischemarkt" case="s1"'

The node loads **only** its party's records and answers `query.ask_field`.
Every answer is a projected scalar or a typed refusal.

No model runs here: a projection is a function, not inference. So the party
does not have to lend the federation a model -- which is a good part of the
reason it takes part at all.

Three bolts, independent of each other:

1. **The node does not have it.** `raw_records_for_party` opens only its own
   files. Another customer's contract does not exist in memory here.
2. **The matrix projects.** `Field.project` raises `not_in_matrix` if the asker
   is not allowed to see the field.
3. **The transport carries only scalars.** `fact_record` rejects a raw object,
   even if the matrix wrongly allowed it.
