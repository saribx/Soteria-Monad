"""Chained receipts. Each one holds the head of the previous one.

A single receipt says "this happened". A chain also says "and nothing before it
was changed afterwards", because every entry goes into the hash of the next.
`verify()` recomputes them; a changed field anywhere in the middle shows up.

The hash is truncated to 16 hex characters. That is not cryptography for real
emergencies but a checksum that fits on a slide -- and the honesty table says
exactly that.
