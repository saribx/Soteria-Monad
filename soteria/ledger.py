"""Budget enforcement, taint tracking and the audit trail.

Every hop between agents is recorded here and emitted to the frontend, so
"safety and oversight" is something a judge can watch happen live rather than a
claim on a slide.

Three things this module is careful about, because the first version got each of
them wrong:

- **The clock is a ceiling, not a turnstile.** `remaining_seconds()` is consulted
  before every model call and every connector call, and is handed to the SDK as
  a per-request timeout, so a run cannot quietly finish past its budget.
- **Refusals are counted even when nobody was listening.** A blocked tool call
  is recorded against the run whether or not it happened inside a delegation.
  An audit that under-reports violations is worse than no audit.
- **Taint is coarse and therefore sound.** Once a private-data role reports into
  a run, any later delegation to a role holding an outbound tool is refused. No
  string is ever inspected, so there is nothing to paraphrase around.
