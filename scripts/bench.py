"""The four numbers. From runs, not from gut feeling.

    uv run python scripts/bench.py

Runs every case through the same `Assessor` class as the federation, checks the
boundary proof and writes `view/fixtures/bench.json` for the case overview.

**What each number claims -- and what it does not.**

1. Time to decision. The logic is measured without transport; the real
   federation takes 3-7 s. Both are reported. The phone-chain
   baseline is an ASSUMPTION, not a measurement.
2. Hit rate. Split into known cases and holdout. `policy.py` was written
   against the known cases, so their rate is a consistency check. As long as
   the ground truth is marked PROPOSAL, it is also unconfirmed -- and that is
   stated next to the number.
3. Tightness. From scripts/wire_proof.py, with a denominator: attempted
   crossings, refused ones, authorised raw disclosures, violations.
4. Behaviour with a gap. Every case is run a second time with the customer
   offline. No case has that built in -- so it is generated, and it says so.
